\textbf{\huge \bf Basics of Compiler Design\hspace{1.5cm} 13}
\end{flushleft}
\textbf{\bf Introduction}
 When we have learnt different programming languages like C, C++ or Java we got familiar with the term compiler. As an example, for C and C++ we have found Turbo C compiler, for Java we have seen Java compiler and so on. Most of the students have a wrong idea that compilation is required only to check the errors. But this is not the only job for a compiler, its job is much wider than error checking. Compiler is basically built on the knowledge of Automata. To learn different phases of compiler we need the knowledge of Finite Automata, Regular Expression, Context Free Grammar etc. Compiler needs a vast discussion, but in this section we shall discuss only those parts which are directly related to Automata.

\textbf{ \bf 13.1 Definition}\\   
Compiler is a program that takes a program written in a source language and translates it into an equivalent program in a target language. In relation to compiler the source language is human readable  language called High Level Language and target language is machine readable code called machine level language. In the operational process of a compiler it reports the programmer the presence of errors in the source program. The block diagram of compiler is shown in Fig. 13.1.

\textbf{13.2 Types of Compiler}\\
 Compilers are classiﬁ ed mainly into three types according to their operational process.  1. Single pass: In computer programming, a single pass or one-pass compiler is a compiler that scans through the source code of each compilation unit only once. In other words, a singlepass compiler does not ‘look back’ the code it has previously processed. Sometimes single pass
